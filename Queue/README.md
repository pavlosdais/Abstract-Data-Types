[Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

The 2 basic operations performed are:
* Enqueue: Adds an item at the end of the queue.
* Dequeue: Removes an item from the start of the queue.

Space	     | O(n)	        | O(n)
Enqueue	   | O(1)	        | O(1)
Dequeue	   | O(1)	        | O(1)
