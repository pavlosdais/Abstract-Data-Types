[Hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) also known as hash map, is a data structure that implements a set abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots from which the desired value can be found.

# Implementations

This ADT has the following implementations:
- Linear hashing
- Separate chaining
- Double hashing
- Using Red-Black Trees

# Hash Functions
A file with (good) hash functions for strings and integers is also included.
