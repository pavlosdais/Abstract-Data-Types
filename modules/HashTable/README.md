[Hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) also known as hash map, is a data structure that implements a set abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots from which the desired value can be found.

This ADT has the following implementations:
- [Separate chaining](https://github.com/pavlosdais/Abstract-Data-Types/tree/main/modules/HashTable/SeparateChaining#readme)
- [Double hashing](https://github.com/pavlosdais/Abstract-Data-Types/tree/main/modules/HashTable/DoubleHashing#readme)
- [Using Red-Black Trees](https://github.com/pavlosdais/Abstract-Data-Types/tree/main/modules/HashTable/UsingRBT#readme)

# Hash Functions
A file with (good) hash functions for strings and integers is also included.
