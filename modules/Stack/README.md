[Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is LIFO (Last In First Out). <br/>

The 2 basic operations performed are:
* Push: Adds an item at the top of the stack.
* Pop: Removes an item from the top of the stack.

If n is the number of elements in the stack:

Algorithm  | Average case | Worst case
---------- | -------      | ----------
Space	   | Θ(n)	      | O(n)
Push	   | Θ(1)	      | O(1)
Pop 	   | Θ(1)	      | O(1)
