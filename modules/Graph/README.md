A [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes. A graph data structure consists of a finite set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph, known as edges.

This ADT has the following implementations:
* [Directed Graph](https://github.com/pavlosdais/Abstract-Data-Types/tree/main/modules/Graph/DirectedGraph#readme)
* [Undirected Graph](https://github.com/pavlosdais/Abstract-Data-Types/tree/main/modules/Graph/UndirectedGraph#readme)
* [Weighted Undirected Graph](https://github.com/pavlosdais/Abstract-Data-Types/tree/main/modules/Graph/WeightedUndirectedGraph#readme)

Each of which, has implemented algorithms associated with them.
