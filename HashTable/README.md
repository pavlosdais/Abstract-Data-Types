[Hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) also known as hash map, is a data structure that implements a set abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Performance
This is a simple static hash table, meaning all elemenets in it as well as its size are final and not changing. So, its uses are limited since rehashing would be necessary.
